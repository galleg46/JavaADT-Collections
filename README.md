# ADT-Collections
A homework assignment where I implemented a ParticleCollection ADT along with implementing/using iterators

For this ADT, I used the standard Java Collection interface.

ParticleCollection is a Particle array-based implementation of Collection by extending AbstractCollection.

Just like ADT-ParticleSequence, this project also simulates gravity between multiple planets.
